          <p class="aboutPara">Clothing is a product that nearly everyone invests in. However, most people are not educated on where their clothes come from. Clothes bought from fast fashion industries, which is where the majority of people shop, are produced unethically and unsustainably. Typically, the purpose of fast fashion companies is to be able to sell clothing that mimics that of high fashion clothing and trends while providing the consumer with cheap costs. Due to the fact that the clothing is incredibly inexpensive, two things are sacrificed: the quality and the wages of the laborers. The quality of clothing constantly declining makes it even more wasteful as the clothes cannot last as long. On top of this, fast fashion companies exploit women and children in developing world countries for their labor and take advantage of the lack of labor laws in these countries. To avoid shopping unethical and unsustainable brands, here are some alternatives!</p>
          <br>
          <p class="aboutPara">Thrifting: Buying clothes from thrift stores is one of the easiest and most effective ways to avoid letting clothes go to waste.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="aboutPara">Shopping from Ethical Brands: There are many who find thrifting to be a hassle and would rather just buy from a ready to wear clothing store but at the same time, do not want to contribute to waste. That is where ethical ready to wear brands come in</p>
          <br>
          <p class= "aboutPara">At the end of the day, it is impractical to ask that EVERYONE change their ways and shop from thrift stores or expensive ethical clothing brands. So if you continue to shop from fast fashion brands, be mindful when you shop and understand the work that goes into it and the waste that result.</p>
